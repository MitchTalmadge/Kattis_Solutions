# Kattis_Solutions
My solutions to various Kattis challenges.

Kattis is an online programming competition platform. They have many fun programming challenges, and you can use almost any language of your choosing to complete them. I tend to use Python, as scripting languages tend to be much faster for challenges like these.

- The "solved" folder contains working solutions to the problems.
- The "failed" folder contains solutions that did not pass and that I have not had a chance to finish.
- Solutions in the root of the directory are WIP.

Solutions are named by their challenge name, not challenge ID.
